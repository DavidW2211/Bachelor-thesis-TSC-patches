# Bachelor-thesis-TSC-patches

*Summary*:
Fabrication instructions &amp; further details concerning the creation of TSC patches.

## Introducion

Like the thesis the TSC patches are presented in 3 categories: Spikes, Bumps and Waves.  
If you don't know what TSC tiles are, please feel free to read my bachelor's thesis first. For the construction of a certain TSC patch we provide instructions and the used 3D models.
Note that the patches consist not only of the top surface, but also a bottom part. Since the bottom parts are reused by many patches and we want to avoid dupllication we put them in the folder *Base-3D-Models* and we state which one is needed for a certain patch. The *Clamps-3D-Models* folder works the same way, they are needed by lots of different patches.

## Setting Up &amp; Combining 3D Models

We use the Ultimaker Cura software for printing. There you only need 2 steps:  
1. Select the right material for each part of the patch on the left side (IMAGE)
2. Select all patches that need to be merged --> Right click and select merge models (IMAGE)
3. 3D print the structure (We recomment to use a TPU brim with brim ALSO in the inside, because the PLA sticks more to the blue tape and this reduces breaking parts)

## Material Information

For all the patches we used following resources:   
1. Industrial glue + granulate (LINK)
2. TPU 95A (LINK)
3. Ultimaker PLA (LINK)
4. Jumper wires (LINK)
5. Arduino Uno (LINK)
6. Straightening SMAs (0.5 mm) (LINK)
7. Springs (LINK)
