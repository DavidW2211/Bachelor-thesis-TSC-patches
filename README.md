## Introduction

Texture surface change tiles (TSC tiles) are patches, that are able to change their topology. If you want to know more about TSC tiles, please feel free to read my bachelor's thesis, available in the repository.
In this repository we provide instructions and 3D models, for the construction of a certain TSC patch.
Like in the thesis the TSC patches are structured in 3 categories: Spikes, Bumps and Waves.  
Note that the patches consist not only of the top surface, but also a bottom part. Since the bottom parts are reused by many patches and we want to avoid dupllication we put them in the folder *BottomPart-3D-Models* and we state which one is needed for a certain patch. The *Clamps-3D-Models* folder works the same way, they are needed by lots of different patches.

Please read the following general fabrication information, before you continue with building a TSC.

## Actuation information

We use shape memory alloys (SMAs) for actuation. SMAs are alloys, that remember their initial form. In the cold state we can deform the SMA and when we heat it, it changes the shape back to its remembered form. For our patches we used 2 types of different SMAs: 

1. Straightening SMAs &#8594; If we heat them, they will form a straight line
2. Springs &#8594; If we heat them, they contract 

The drawback is that our used SMAs are only unidirecional and therefore we must reverse the actuation by hand (We used them, because they are cheap). But you also have the choice to buy more expensive bidirectional SMAs, to solve this problem. For example, they might expand on heating and shrink when they cool down.


## Printing information

We use the Ultimaker Cura software for printing. In the following, we list the steps for multimaterial 3D printing: 
1. Select the right material (Will be stated in the instruction steps) for each part of the patch on the left side

2. Select all patches that need to be merged &#8594; Right click and select merge models. They should snap together.

3. 3D print the structure 

Furthermore, we recommend to use a TPU brim with the brim ALSO on the inside, because the PLA sticks more to the blue tape than TPU and this reduces breaking parts

## Glueing information
We use industrial glue in combination with granulate to glue the 3D printed parts and the SMAs together:

1. The parts are designed such that it is possible to add the granulate BEFORE the glue. This way the granulate soaks up the glue and it does not stick together parts that shouldn't be connected.
2. Be careful with the glue, your hands stick immediately to the surface! We recomment using a metal pin or something that doesn't glue immediately for the case that you need to replace or press down something while gluing.

## Soldering information

The fact, that the solder does not stick to the SMA is problematic. That's why we changed the soldering process a little bit:

1. Fold the tip of the jumper wire

2. Put the SMA between the jumper wire and press the jumper wire shut, such that the SMA can't move

3. Put solder around the jumper wire, such that it encapsulates the SMA

4. If the jumper wire can't be moved by hand you are finished.

## Digital circuit

We used an arduino uno to actuate our patches digitally. The only problem with the arduino is, that it gives us max 20mA and we need about 1.2A per actuated patch. Therefore, we must use an external power source, e.g., a battery. Moreover, we use a MOSFET as a gate to control the current flow and actuate the TSC tiles through code of the arduino. The circuit diagram can be seen in the following:

Instead of the 5V pin, the MOSFET should be opened by setting a digital pin to HIGH.

## Database

To give the user a better overview of the toolbox, we implemented a database that is located in the following folder:

`./TSC_Tiles_Database/Builds/TSC_Tiles_Database.exe` 

The created database helps users to find specific patches that fit their needs. Therefore, this database contains a list of all patches that are part of the toolbox. There are 3 different options for how to filter these patches. First, one can set the introspective quality ratings to a specific value and only patches that have the same or higher value get displayed in the list. Secondly, there is a list of toggles for all classification criteria. Initially, all toggles are ticked. The list works like the following. If a specific classification criterion is deselected, then every patch that includes this excluded criterion does not get displayed in the list. For instance, if one wants to only search for spikes, then one needs to uncheck the bump and wave categories. Lastly, one can also search for patches directly by name. The search checks whether the entered pattern occurs somewhere in a patch name. This search is also case insensitive. We also added the option to reset all criteria. This sets all slider values to very bad, ticks all classification boxes and clears the pattern search input field.
The second part of the database contains details for each patch. If we click on a certain patch in the overview list then we open the detail page for this patch. This detail page consists of images of the patch, a clickable link to the page of this patch in this GitHub repository and the introspective quality ratings, as well as the classification list.
