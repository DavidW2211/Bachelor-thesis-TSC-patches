# Bachelor-thesis-TSC-patches

*Summary*:
Fabrication instructions &amp; further details concerning the creation of TSC patches.

## Introducion

Like in the thesis the TSC patches are structured in 3 categories: Spikes, Bumps and Waves.  
If you don't know what TSC tiles are, please feel free to read my bachelor's thesis first. For the construction of a certain TSC patch we provide instructions and the used 3D models.
Note that the patches consist not only of the top surface, but also a bottom part. Since the bottom parts are reused by many patches and we want to avoid dupllication we put them in the folder *BottomPart-3D-Models* and we state which one is needed for a certain patch. The *Clamps-3D-Models* folder works the same way, they are needed by lots of different patches.

## Setting Up &amp; Combining 3D Models

We use the Ultimaker Cura software for printing. There you only need 2 steps: 
1. Select the right material for each part of the patch on the left side

2. Select all patches that need to be merged -> Right click and select merge models. They should snap together.

3. 3D print the structure


## Print information

1. The top surface parts and the corresponding bottom part get printed seperately and need to be glued together
2. We recomment to use a TPU brim with the brim ALSO on the inside, because the PLA sticks more to the blue tape than TPU and this reduces breaking parts
3. Let the print cool enough, otherwise the PLA might deform while removing the print

## Glueing information

1. The parts are designed such that it is possible to add the granulate BEFORE the glue. This way the granulate soaks up the glue and it does not stick together parts that shouldn't be connected.
2. Be careful with the glue, your hands stick immediately to the surface! We recomment using a metal pin or something that doesn't glue immediately for the case that you need to replace or press down something while gluing.

## Material Information

For all the patches we used following resources:   
1. Industrial glue + granulate (LINK)
2. TPU 95A (LINK)
3. Ultimaker PLA (LINK)
4. Jumper wires (LINK)
5. Arduino Uno (LINK)
6. Straightening SMAs (0.5 mm) (LINK)
7. Springs (LINK)
