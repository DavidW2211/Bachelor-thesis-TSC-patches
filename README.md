# Bachelor-thesis-TSC-patches

*Summary*:
Fabrication instructions &amp; further details concerning the creation of TSC patches.

Like the thesis the TSC patches are presented in 3 categories: Spikes, Bumps and Waves.  
If you don't know what TSC tiles are, please feel free to read my bachelor's thesis first. For the construction of a certain TSC patch we provide instructions and the used 3D models.

## General Information

For all the patches we used following resources:   
1. Industrial glue + granulate (LINK)
2. TPU 95A (LINK)
3. Ultimaker PLA (LINK)
4. Jumper wires (LINK)
5. Arduino Uno (LINK)
6. Straightening SMAs (0.5 mm) (LINK)
