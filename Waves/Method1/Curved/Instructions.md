## Instructions
1. Drag the PLA and TPU 3D models into ultimaker editor (NOT the reinforcement, this gets printed seperately!)
2. Select their materials (Name of the 3D model)
3. Merge them
4. Scale them (We used 35 mm x 35 mm; height unscaled)
5. Add 2 HalfCircle clamps on the opposing centers of the surface as in the image (You must place them by hand, since the models did not belong together)
6. Print them 
7. `Optional`: If cuts in the 3D print are not clear (e.g., printed together), then use a cutter to open them
8. 3D print the PLA_Reinforcement (Same percentage scale as other parts)
9. 3D print the bottom part ''BottomPartSquared'' (Same size as in step 3, height can be used as needed:  
 *The bottom part may have a far smaller height as in the image &#8594; Minimum size = diameter of the spring*)
9. Cut **spring** SMA to the desired length (We used 9-10 links of the spring)
10. `Optional`: Solder 2 jumper wires to the SMA
11. Stick the SMA ends into the clamps (If something breaks don't worry it gets glued anyway)
12. `For both ends`: Glue the SMA and clamp together (Add granulate around the clamp &#8594; add glue)
13. Stick the reinforcement into the frame under the surface (See ''Compression Wave Base'') and glue it
14. Glue bottom part to the top surface (Add glue â†’ press top surface to bottom part)
15. Power the patch for actuation (We used 5V and 1.2A)
