1. Drag the two provided 3D models into ultimaker editor
2. Select their materials, labeled by the 3D model
3. Merge them
4. Scale them (We used TODO mm x 25 mm; height unscaled)
5. Print them
6. 3D print the bottom part ''BottomPartRect_Hole'' (Same size as in step 3, height can be adjusted if needed)
7. `Optional`: Do steps 7-11 twice and insert an SMA on each spike, such that we can decide which side we pull up.
8. Cut **straightening** SMA to the desired length (We used ca. 20 mm)
9. `Optional`: Solder 2 jumper wires to the SMA
10. Glue SMA to the top surface (Put SMA into the hole &#8594; fill with granulate &#8594; add glue)
11. Glue SMA to bottom part (Put SMA into the hole &#8594; fill with granulate &#8594; add glue)
12. Glue bottom part to the top surface (Add granulate to the splice &#8594; add glue)
13. Power the patch for actuation (We used 5V and 1.2A)
