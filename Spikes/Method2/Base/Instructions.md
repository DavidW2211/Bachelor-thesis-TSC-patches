## Important
This patch is not 100% evolved. Because the spring is too close to the surface it melts after some actuations. 
If you want to use this patch try to place a heat resistant layer between the SMA and the surface.

1. Drag the PLA and TPU 3D models into ultimaker editor (NOT the reinforcement, this gets printed seperately!)
2. Merge them
3. Scale them (We used 25 mm x 25 mm)
4. Add 2 HalfCircle clamps on the corners as in the image
5. Print it
6. 3D print the PLA_Reinforcement
7. 3D print the bottom part ''BottomPartSquared'' (Same size as in step 3, height can be used as needed)
8. Cut **spring** SMA to the desired length (We used 1-2 links of the spring)
9. `Optional`: Solder 2 jumper wires to the SMA
10. Stick the SMA ends into the clamps (If something breaks don't worry it gets glued anyway)
11. `For both ends`: Glue the SMA and clamp together (Add granulate around the clamp &#8594; add glue)
12. Glue bottom part to the top surface (Add granulate to the splice &#8594; add glue)
13. Power the patch for actuation (We used 5V and 1A)
