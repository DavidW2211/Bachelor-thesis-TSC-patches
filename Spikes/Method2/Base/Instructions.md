#Important
This patch is not 100% evolved. Because the spring is too close to the surface it melts after some actuations. 
If you want to use this patch try to place a heat resistant layer between the SMA and the surface.

1. Drag the PLA and TPU 3D models into ultimaker editor (NOT the reinforcement, this gets printed seperately!)
2. Merge them
3. Scale them (We used 25 mm x 25 mm)
4. Print them
5. 3D print the PLA_Reinforcement
6. 3D print the bottom part ''BottomPartSquared'' (Same size as in step 3, height can be used as needed)
7. Cut **spring** SMA to the desired length (We used 1-2 links of the spring)
8. `Optional`: Solder 2 jumper wires to the SMA
9. Glue SMA to the top surface (Put SMA into the hole &#8594; fill with granulate &#8594; add glue)
10. Glue SMA to bottom part (Put SMA into the hole &#8594; fill with granulate &#8594; add glue)
11. Glue bottom part to the top surface (Add granulate to the surface &#8594; add glue)
12. Power the patch for actuation (We used 5V and 1A)
